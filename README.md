# semi-random

This is the Tensorflow implementation of deep semi-random units proposed in [1].

The file `semi_random.py` contains the semi-random units for convolution and fully connected layers.

The files `mnist.py` and `cifar10*.py` are modified from the examples of Tensorflow to demonstrate how to use the semi-random units on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.
